  # The ultimate offline experience

</div>

<p class="subtitle">
  This project was conceived out of a desire to create an offline experience for
  the web that felt natural, instead of clunky or non-existent.
</p>

The end result will benefit all users by improving performance through intelligent
caching and progressive enhancement techniques.

So, that sounds cool, but what does it looks like and how would it work?&hellip;

## Network first

<p class="subtitle">
  Cache essential downloaded content
</p>

An undeniable truth of the web is that the websites content isn't going to be
delivered to your computer without any network connection. This is why "offline
first" could be misleading terminology. If there is no connection at all on first
visit then there is no choice but to fall back to the browsers default handling
of the situation.

But assuming there is a connection, the page will load and after some time the
user will hopefully click through to an interesting link.

While this is happening essential downloaded content should be being stored in
a cache for later use.

Eventually the user returns to the original web page, on the same day or a week
later looking to re-read or find other interesting content on the page&hellip;

##Â Cache to the rescue

<p class="subtitle">
  Content should be cache first then <i>enhanced</i> using the network
</p>

Another undeniable truth of the web is, users connections can't be relied upon.
Inevitably, connection issues occur, either the network drops out or becomes so
slow the website is unusable.

The page might look like this now&hellip;

Or this&hellip;

Even if the connection doesn't cause issues, why should the user have to
re-download the content that's already been downloaded?

They shouldn't&hellip;while online, downloaded essential network requests and
assets were cached depending on what the user has viewed.

The cache is reliable, the connection is not. Therefore, the content should be
cache first then *enhanced* using the network.

## Not everything is cached

<p class="subtitle">
  Provide a visual indication of content that is unavailable or may be slow
</p>

There's still a lot of content on the web page that hasn't been cached yet, if
the users connection isn't good enough they'll have trouble viewing it.

Traditionally, a user would innocently click through without knowing this.
Inevitably they will end up:

- Getting frustrated with the wait
- Left with either a blank page or assets, styles and text loading at different times
- Thinking other areas of the website will feature the same degraded experience
- Blaming the website for being slow and leave

The web can be better than that and so, we should go a step further.

This can be achieved by providing a visual indication of content that is unavailable
or may be slow.

## Getting re-connected

<p class="subtitle">
  Content seamlessly becomes available
</p>

![A standard website](/assets/the-ultimate-offline-experience/re-connected.png)

The cache is still used to improve performance but once a network connection is
regained the website is no longer completely reliant on the cache.

Just as visual indicators were used to warn users about issues with content
loading they should now be used to inform them that the same content is now safe
to view.

This might happen while the user is viewing the page or after they return to it.

## Do it!

*Won't this be hard?* I hear you, that's why this exists, it's a deep dive on
subjects surrounding progressive enhancement techniques and the offline web experience.

The best techniques will be uncovered and a lot of them won't be as difficult
as you might think to implement.

So if you're interested in building better web experiences, let's get started!
