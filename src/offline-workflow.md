  # Offline workflow

</div>

<p class="subtitle">
  The ultimate offline user experience wouldn't be complete without accounting
  for the experience of the developer.
</p>

Maintaining offline content and service worker code shouldn't take manual effort
or become a messy process for developers. If it does we'd be risking future errors
creeping in, or the offline experience becoming too costly to keep in place.

By adding an automated build step into the workflow, we can reduce service worker
startup times and automate generating caches at build time to avoid manual effort
and human error.

## Problems with the current workflow

The [implementation so far](/versioning-offline-content.html) has two problems.

Firstly, developers have to remember to call `workbox injectManifest` to update
the precache, every single time. This might not seem like much, but it'd be easy
to forget and the consequence for forgetting would lead to out of date content
being served.

The second problem is less obvious, but you might have already noticed it if you
looked at the browsers network tab ðŸ˜¬

![Workbox modules](/assets/offline-workflow/workbox-modules.png)

Currently, the Workbox code in the service worker uses a CDN script, the script is
smart because it only includes what it needs, but it still adds overhead. Pulling
the scripts down from the network increase the service workers startup time and
reliance on the network.

We could just inline all the library code into the service worker file ourself,
doing so would not only cause a huge unruly unmaintainable mess in the service
worker file but also make handling versions of the library code very difficult.

Fortunately, Workbox makes its modules available via NPM. Using NPM will bring the
added benefit of better versioning and security vulnerability detection on top of
the performance benefits!

Let's look at how through using a build step we can automate calling `workbox injectManifest`
at the same time as enabling use of Workbox modules from NPM.

## The build step

It's important to plan out the build step before diving in, it can get complicated
so nailing down specific outcomes will help keep our efforts focussed.

A good build step clearly separates config files, editable source files and built
distributed files.

Hopefully, we'll be able to maintain an organised folder structure with config
files in the root, source files in the `src` directory and built distributed files
in the `dist` directory. We can start representing this structure by moving the source
files including the service worker template file into a `src` directory and leaving
`workbox-config.js` in the root&hellip;

```bash
|- src/
|  |- service-worker.js
|  |- styles.css
|  |- index.html
|  |- image.jpeg
|- workbox-config.js
```

Then `workbox-config.js` can be updated to match the new folder structure&hellip;

```javascript
export default {
  "globDirectory": "src",
  "globPatterns": ["*.{html,css}"],
  "swSrc": "src/service-worker.js",
  "swDest": "dist/service-worker.js"
};
```

## Automate generating caches at build time

Workbox has an integration for most popular build tools and frameworks, the build
tool this example is going to use is [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/),
the Workbox plugin for Rollup uses the same configuration options as Workbox. So,
it'll allow us to mostly keep the same setup.

To start off we'll need to download Rollup and the Rollup workbox plugin from NPM&hellip;

```bash
npm i -D rollup rollup-plugin-workbox
```



Currently the list of included modules looks like this&hellip;

```javascript
importScripts('https://storage.googleapis.com/workbox-cdn/releases/5.0.0/workbox-sw.js');
const { registerRoute } = workbox.routing;
const { precacheAndRoute } = workbox.precaching;
const { CacheFirst } = workbox.strategies;
const { ExpirationPlugin } = workbox.expiration;
```

Workbox modules on NPM follow the same naming format, just swapping the dots for
hyphens. Let's download all the ones being used&hellip;

```bash
npm i -D workbox-routing workbox-precaching workbox-strategies workbox-expiration
```

The modules can then be swapped out with import statements. We don't need the `importScripts`
line anymore either, that was only used to pull in the modules that the service worker
was using&hellip;

```javascript
import { registerRoute } from 'workbox-routing';
import { precacheAndRoute } from 'workbox-precaching';
import { CacheFirst } from 'workbox-strategies';
import { ExpirationPlugin } from 'workbox-expiration';
```

If `workbox injectManifest` is re-run now, the output `service-worker.js` file will
include these import statements.

Unfortunately, most browsers can't read import statements, we wouldn't want to include
`node_modules` directly in the website anyway. Instead, the modules should be *bundled*
into the service worker using a *build* step.

For this example we'll use [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/) to bundle the
code. That means more NPM installs to get Rollup and all the plugins we're going
to need&hellip;

```bash
npm i -D rollup @rollup/plugin-node-resolve @rollup/plugin-replace rollup-plugin-copy rollup-plugin-terser rollup-plugin-workbox
```

During the build step, Rollup is going to take the `service-worker.js` file and change
all the imports to directly include the code they're referencing.

A good build step clearly separates config files in the root directory, from website
source files in the src directory and the built distributed files in the dist directory.
Let's start by updating the `workbox-config.js` to match that structure&hellip;

```javascript
export default {
  "globDirectory": "src",
  "globPatterns": ["*.{html,css}"],
  "swSrc": "src/service-worker.js",
  "swDest": "dist/service-worker.js"
};
```

Creating a `rollup.config.js` file in the project root directory we can tell Rollup
what to do&hellip;

```javascript
import resolve from '@rollup/plugin-node-resolve';
import replace from '@rollup/plugin-replace';
import copy from 'rollup-plugin-copy';
import { terser } from 'rollup-plugin-terser';
import { injectManifest } from 'rollup-plugin-workbox';
import workboxConfig from './workbox-config.js';

export default [
  // Generate the service worker
  {
    input: 'src/service-worker.js',
    output: { dir: 'dist', format: 'cjs' },
    plugins: [injectManifest(workboxConfig)]
  },
  // bundle imports, minify and copy the rest of the files into the dist dir
  {
    input: 'dist/service-worker.js',
    output: { dir: 'dist', format: 'cjs' },
    plugins: [
      resolve(),
      replace({ 'process.env.NODE_ENV': JSON.stringify('production') }),
      terser(),
      copy({ targets: [{ src: 'src/*', dest: 'dist/' }] })
    ]
  }
];
```

Rollup will take the input service worker files and run them through the list of
plugins&hellip;

- `injectManifest(workboxConfig)` performs exactly the same action as the
`workbox injectManifest` command was previously, but this time it'll output `service-worker.js`
in the dist folder.
- `resolve()` bundles the imports
- `replace({ 'process.env.NODE_ENV': JSON.stringify('production') })` uses Workbox
production mode
- `terser()` minifies the code that workbox outputs, a good idea seeing as we're
doing this for performance
- `copy({ targets: [{ src: 'src/*', dest: 'dist/' }] })` will move all the files
within the /src directory to the /dist directory

<div class="callout">
  
  **Remember:** Every browser that supports service workers also supports most
  ES2015 features, it's not necessary to include Babel to this stack.

</div>

This config uses the `output` property to tell Workbox to put the final service
worker file in the `dist` folder which will overwrite the one that workbox generates.

As a final step we should separate the website files from config files by creating
the `src` folder. Move the `index.html`, `image.jpeg` and `styles.css` to it then
update the `globDirectory` set in `workbox-config.js`.

Phew! Now if we run `rollup -c` the complete `service-worker.js` file will get output
in the `dist` directory safe to use in the browser.

## Conclusion

With the caching and service worker powers acquired so far we're ready to start
implementing features to attain the *ultimate offline experience*.
