  # Versioning offline content

</div>

<p class="subtitle">
  A well implemented cache is fundamental to keeping a website performant and
  functional despite unreliable connections.
</p>

There's still lots of holes in the basic implementation provided in the
[my first offline website](/my-first-offline-website.html) article, it would be
tough to manually maintain the cache and avoid it going stale in any but the simplest
of websites.

Luckily there are tools available that make reliably maintaining even the largest
frequently updating caches manageable.

## The same cache, but better

To start with, lets take the cache we already have and re-implement it. This time
the cache is going to be built with [Workbox](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox),
an open source library from Google.

Here's the service worker code from [my first offline website](/my-first-offline-website.html)...

```javascript
const cacheName = 'offline';
const image = new Request('/image.jpeg', { cache: 'reload' });
const thingsToCache = ['/', 'index.html', 'styles.css', image];

const cacheResources = async () => {
  const cache = await caches.open(cacheName);
  return cache.addAll(thingsToCache);
};

const getResponse = async request => {
  const cache = await caches.open(cacheName);
  const cachedResponse = await cache.match(request);
  return cachedResponse || fetch(request);
};

const cleanup = async () => {
  const cacheNames = await caches.keys();
  await Promise.all(cacheNames.map(name => (
    name !== cacheName && caches.delete(name)
  )));
};

self.addEventListener('install', event => {
  event.waitUntil(cacheResources());
  self.skipWaiting();
});

self.addEventListener('fetch', event => {
  event.respondWith(getResponse(event.request));
});

self.addEventListener('activate', event => {
  event.waitUntil(cleanup());
});
```

Here's the same implementation in Workbox...

```javascript
importScripts('https://storage.googleapis.com/workbox-cdn/releases/5.0.0/workbox-sw.js');

const cacheFirst = new workbox.strategies.CacheFirst({
  cacheName: 'offline'
});

workbox.routing.registerRoute('/', cacheFirst);
workbox.routing.registerRoute(
  new RegExp('\.(?:css|html|jpeg)$'),
  cacheFirst
);

self.addEventListener('install', () => {
  self.skipWaiting();
});
```

Much cleaner right!

We're using `workbox.strategies.CacheFirst` for the home route or any files ending
in .css, .jpeg or .html (based on the regex). This will handle:

1. Attempting to serve content from a cache called "offline"
2. Falling back to the network if nothing is found in the cache
3. Updating the cache with the network response

It'll also cleanup stale caches for us too.

You can view the working [source code and demo](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/workbox-cache)
for this cache or learn more about other caching strategies on the [Workbox website](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/modules/workbox-strategies)

So far, this cache only replicates the functionality of the last one with less
lines of code. This still leaves the same two big problems:

- The cache will not automatically update on content changes. People who have
already viewed the site will all see out of date content.
- If we update the cache by changing the caches name the entire cache will need
to be re-downloaded, instead of just the content that updated.

## A better way to version caches

Workbox has a concept called "precaching". It involves defining a set of files
along with version info that will be downloaded and cached on the service worker
"install" event.

It's possible to manually change the current service worker to use precaching, here's
how it would look...

```javascript
importScripts('https://storage.googleapis.com/workbox-cdn/releases/5.0.0/workbox-sw.js');

workbox.precaching.precacheAndRoute([
  {
    "revision": "1",
    "url": "image.jpeg"
  }, {
    "revision":"1",
    "url":"index.html"
  }, {
    "revision":"1",
    "url":"styles.css"
  }
]);

self.addEventListener('install', () => {
  self.skipWaiting();
});
```

The `precacheAndRoute` function is really smart.

Changing the `revision` property on any of the files will cause
the cache to update **only where the revision has changed**. This avoids having to
update the entire cache when only part of it changes.

The `precacheAndRoute` function will handle storing all the URLs in the cache and
setting up individual routes for them using the `CacheFirst` strategy.

Another really handy feature is that it will account for common URL practices, we
no longer need an extra route for `/` because `precacheAndRoute` will automatically
to match it to `index.html`.

Great! Now we just need a way to automatically update the revision number when
files change.

## Update caches on detected file changes

The implementation needs to move away from manually defining a list of files and
revision information. It's error prone and will take too much work to maintain in
a large codebase. The list of files and versions needs to be generated instead.

Workbox offers a few ways to generate the list of files at build time, the simplest
option is [Workbox CLI](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/modules/workbox-cli)
which we'll be using here.

To get started, install the CLI `npm i -g workbox-cli` and run the wizard by using
`workbox wizard`...

```bash
> workbox wizard

? Please enter the path to the root of your web app: .
? Which file types would you like to precache? jpeg, html, css
? Where would you like your service worker file to be saved? service-worker.js
? Where would you like to save these configuration options? workbox-config.js
```

The wizard creates a config file that it will chuck in the
projects root directory called `workbox-config.js`...

```javascript
module.exports = {
  "globDirectory": ".",
  "globPatterns": [
    "*.{jpeg,html,css}"
  ],
  "swDest": "service-worker.js"
};
```

This config only has a destination defined in `swDest`, so it would work with
the `workbox generateSW` command which generates the whole service worker for us.

`workbox-config.js` also accepts an `swSrc` property which tells workbox to use a
template service worker file instead of creating it's own one. We're going to need
that extra control, so let's define `swSrc` as `service-worker-template.js`...

```javascript
module.exports = {
  "globDirectory": ".",
  "globPatterns": [
    "*.{jpeg,html,css}"
  ],
  "swSrc": "service-worker-template.js",
  "swDest": "service-worker.js"
};
```

To create the `service-worker-template.js` file, we can rename the current service
worker file and update it to replace the list of files with `self.__WB_MANIFEST`...

```javascript
importScripts('https://storage.googleapis.com/workbox-cdn/releases/5.0.0/workbox-sw.js');

workbox.precaching.precacheAndRoute(
  self.__WB_MANIFEST
);

self.addEventListener('install', () => {
  self.skipWaiting();
});
```

Given a template file Workbox will look for `self.__WB_MANIFEST` and use it to
"inject" the list of files with revision information it generates.

Now that Workbox has a template file to work with it can be told to generate
the service worker using `workbox injectManifest`. The output `service-worker.js`
file will look something like this...

```javascript
importScripts('https://storage.googleapis.com/workbox-cdn/releases/5.0.0/workbox-sw.js');

workbox.precaching.precacheAndRoute([
  {"revision":"13187a99c3b92698b93520df29dc23e4","url":"image.jpeg"},
  {"revision":"a9b2611a124faa588cee9149e1825eeb","url":"index.html"},
  {"revision":"5e89a0d14a7ef2ccb7ae86621bd1c84e","url":"styles.css"}
]);

self.addEventListener('install', () => {
  self.skipWaiting();
});
```

Workbox has generated the list of precache files and revision information for
us ðŸ’ª. Try updating one of the files and running `workbox injectManifest` again,
the revision number should automatically change for the file that was updated!

## Self updating caches

Out of all the content on most websites images are one of the least likely to
regularly update, they also consume the most cache storage space and are often
less essential for the website to work.

If all the images were added as precache files it could be an unnecessary waste
of limited cache storage space. A better approach is to create a separate dedicated
image cache with sensible limits.

Workbox can automatically swap out items in the cache based on a set of configured
limits. A common approach for images is to set a maximum number of images that can
be in the cache at once as well as a time limit using the `ExpirationPlugin` like
so...

```javascript
importScripts('https://storage.googleapis.com/workbox-cdn/releases/5.0.0/workbox-sw.js');

const { registerRoute } = workbox.routing;
const { precacheAndRoute } = workbox.precaching;
const { CacheFirst } = workbox.strategies;
const { ExpirationPlugin } = workbox.expiration;

precacheAndRoute(self.__WB_MANIFEST);

registerRoute(
  /\.(?:png|gif|jpg|jpeg|webp|svg)$/,
  new CacheFirst({
    cacheName: 'images',
    plugins: [
      new ExpirationPlugin({
        maxEntries: 60,
        maxAgeSeconds: 30 * 24 * 60 * 60, // 30 Days
      }),
    ],
  })
);

self.addEventListener('install', () => {
  self.skipWaiting();
});
```

<div class="callout">
  
  **Remember:** The earliest registered route will be used to respond to requests,
  if the precache is above the image cache, the precache takes priority.

</div>

Now that we have a dedicated image cache, the image can be removed from the generated
precache files by removing `jpg` from the `globPatterns` in `workbox-config.js`...

```javascript
module.exports = {
  "globDirectory": ".",
  "globPatterns": [
    "*.{html,css}"
  ],
  "swSrc": "service-worker-template.js",
  "swDest": "service-worker.js"
};
```

Don't forget to re-run `workbox injectManifest` to update the service worker with
these changes!

Every time an image is viewed the service worker will now:

1. intercept the request
2. use the `CacheFirst` strategy to serve from the cache or fall back to the network
3. remove the oldest cache entry if there are now more than 60 entries
4. remove any entries older than 30 days

## Avoid using the Workbox CDN

Currently the Workbox code in the service worker uses a CDN script, the script is
smart because it only includes what it needs, but it still adds overhead.

You might have already noticed this if you looked at the browsers network tab ðŸ˜¬

![Workbox modules](/assets/versioning-offline-content/workbox-modules.png)

Fortunately, Workbox makes its modules available via NPM. Using NPM will bring the
added benefit of better versioning and security vulnerability detection on top of
the performance benefits!

Currently the list of included modules looks like this...

```javascript
importScripts('https://storage.googleapis.com/workbox-cdn/releases/5.0.0/workbox-sw.js');
const { registerRoute } = workbox.routing;
const { precacheAndRoute } = workbox.precaching;
const { CacheFirst } = workbox.strategies;
const { ExpirationPlugin } = workbox.expiration;
```

Workbox modules on NPM follow the same naming format, just swapping the dots for
hyphens. Let's download all the ones being used...

```bash
npm i -D workbox-routing workbox-precaching workbox-strategies workbox-expiration
```

The modules can then be swapped out with import statements. We don't need the `importScripts`
line anymore either, that was only used to pull in the modules that the service worker
was using...

```javascript
import { registerRoute } from 'workbox-routing';
import { precacheAndRoute } from 'workbox-precaching';
import { CacheFirst } from 'workbox-strategies';
import { ExpirationPlugin } from 'workbox-expiration';
```

If `workbox injectManifest` is re-run now, the output `service-worker.js` file will
include these import statements.

Unfortunately, most browsers can't read import statements, we wouldn't want to include
`node_modules` directly in the website anyway. Instead, the modules should be *bundled*
into the service worker.

For this example we'll use [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/) to bundle the
code. That means more NPM installs to get Rollup and all the plugins we're going
to need...

```bash
npm i -D rollup @rollup/plugin-node-resolve rollup-plugin-replace rollup-plugin-terser rollup-plugin-workbox
```

Rollup's job is going to be to take the `service-worker.js` file and change all the
imports to directly include the code they're referencing.

Using a `rollup.config.js` file we can tell it what to do...

```javascript
const resolve = require('@rollup/plugin-node-resolve');
const replace = require('rollup-plugin-replace');
const { terser } = require('rollup-plugin-terser');
const { injectManifest } = require('rollup-plugin-workbox');
const workboxConfig = require('./workbox-config.js')

export default {
  input: 'service-worker-template.js',
  output: {
    dir: 'src',
    format: 'cjs'
  },
  plugins: [
    injectManifest(workboxConfig),
    resolve(),
    replace({ 'process.env.NODE_ENV': JSON.stringify('production') }),
    terser()
  ]
};
```

This will tell Rollup to take the input file `service-worker-template.js` and run
it through the list of plugins...

- `injectManifest(workboxConfig)` performs exactly the same action as the
`workbox injectManifest` command was previously
- `resolve()` bundles the imports
- `replace({ 'process.env.NODE_ENV': JSON.stringify('production') })` uses Workbox
production mode

Seeing as we're doing this for performance `terser()` has been thrown in here to
minify the code that workbox outputs.

<div class="callout">
  
  **Remember:** Every browser that supports service workers also supports most
  ES2015 features, it's not necessary to include Babel to this stack.

</div>

This config uses the `output` property to tell Workbox to put the final service
worker file in a `src` folder.

As a final step we should separate the website files from config files by creating
the `src` folder. Move the `index.html`, `image.jpeg` and `styles.css` to it then
update the `globDirectory` set in `workbox-config.js`.

Phew! Now if we run `rollup -c` the complete `service-worker.js` file will get output
in the `src` directory safe to use in the browser.

## Conclusion

Check out the final [working example](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/workbox-precache)
of the versioned cache.

The cache has been massively improved! Most importantly it can now be sustainably
maintained with little to no effort.

With the caching and service worker powers acquired so far we're ready to start
implementing features to attain the *ultimate offline experience*.
