# A basic cache implementation

Even the most basic cache implementation can simultaneously improve performance
and enable offline use of any website...

---

This experiment is part of the [offline UX project](https://offline.etch.now.sh/).

A basic cache is implemented using `service-worker.js` which stores the image on
initial page load.

## Try it out

- **View App** then click **Fullscreen**
- Go **offline** and reload the page to see the image loaded from the cache. No
connection required ðŸ’ª
