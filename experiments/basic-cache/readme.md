# A basic cache implementation

Even the most basic cache implementation can simultaneously improve performance
and enable offline use of any website...

---

This experiment is part of the [offline project](https://offline.etch.now.sh/).

A basic cache is implemented using `service-worker.js` which stores the image on
initial page load.

Click `View App`, go **offline** and reload the page to see the image loaded
from the cache. No connection required ðŸ’ª
