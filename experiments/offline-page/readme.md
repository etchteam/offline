# Offline page

Implementing an offline page should be just as essential as including a 404 page
on your website...

---

This experiment is part of the [offline UX project](https://offline.etch.now.sh/).

A basic cache is implemented using `service-worker.js` which stores the custom
offline page.

## Try it out

- **View App** then click **Fullscreen**
- Go **offline** and reload the page to see the custom offline page.
